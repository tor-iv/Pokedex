**DESCRIPTION**

Our user-friendly and interactive pokedex can be used by clients in order to search through the
multitude of pokemon (over 800) and can be used to make your own pokedex by allowing the user to 
delete the whole index, create their own, or even update existing pokemon and make them unique.
Our biggest source for our data is a json file with a plethora of pokemon. Specifically it is a big list of dictionaries of the pokemon. Using this json file we were able to create our list and implement it into our REST API.
